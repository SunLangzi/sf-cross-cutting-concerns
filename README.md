# sf-cross-cutting-concerns
Cross cutting concerns for apex code. The previous [cross-cutting concerns](https://github.com/bjanderson70/Apex-Cross-Cutting-Concerns) is NO LONGER supported.

This code designed to encapsulate common cross-cutting concerns (logging, exception handling, caching, etc.).Often times cross-cutting concerns are an after-thought; or, hastily injected without any ability to manage or control.This project was to encapsulate those concerns and provide a mechanism to change/augment. Changing behaviour is a matter of inheritance and specifying choice via custom metadata. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-cross-cutting-concerns/wiki) for more informaiton.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Platform Cache enable; otherwise, caching WILL NOT work.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

All unit tests provide a minimum of 90% code coverage. Tests can be invoked from favortite case tool.
In Salesforce, navigate to Setup->Apex Classes and run all tests

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
